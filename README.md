# calculator

The final project of the Foundations course in T.O.P.
Focus put on the planning and program design beforehand.

# basic structure

The front-end design showcases a calculator, with some basic styling.
Only one webpage necessary, with styles applied through the CSS stylesheet.

The logic of the program is run through the JS files.
Efforts have been made to follow OOP principles, although JS seems
quite loosey-goosey with permissions / access etc.
